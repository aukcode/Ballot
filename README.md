## What is this
This is WIP - Work in progess and under construction. The idea is:
 
This is an app that allows an organization to hold general elections. It's intended use is while holding general assemblies and elections within these. An emphasis have been put on anonymity. Names are associated with polls only, not individual answers.

#### Back-end

- Hapi/Joi for data validation

Make a .env file in the root of the project.
Add two entries to this file:
`DB_CONNECT = <your own mongodb atlas url link>`
